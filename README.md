# Next.js 15 Authentication Error

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when implementing authentication in Next.js 15 applications using `getServerSideProps`. The issue stems from an incorrect usage of `getServerSideProps` within a component that requires authentication, leading to an error if the user is not authenticated.

## Problem Description

The `about.js` file attempts to access user data directly within `getServerSideProps`, causing an error if the user is not logged in. The correct approach involves checking authentication status within `getServerSideProps` and returning appropriate props or redirecting as needed.

## Solution

The `aboutSolution.js` file demonstrates the corrected implementation. It fetches user data within `getServerSideProps` and conditionally renders the content based on authentication status.
